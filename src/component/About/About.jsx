            <br />
            In 2022 I graduated from BrainStationâ€™s full-stack web development
            diploma program, where I strengthened my skills in HTML, CSS, and
            Javascript in a challenging bootcamp. I am most familiar with
            ReactJS as a front-end framework and NodeJS and ExpressJS as
            back-end frameworks, but have also completed various personal
            projects using skills in other technologies such as Nextjs, 3js
            React Native and Firebase.
