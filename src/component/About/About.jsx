        In 2022 I graduated from BrainStationâ€™s full-stack web development
        diploma program, where I strengthened my skills in HTML, CSS, and
        Javascript in a challenging bootcamp. I am most familiar with ReactJS as
        a front-end framework and NodeJS and ExpressJS as back-end frameworks,
        but have also completed various personal projects using skills in other
        technologies such as Nextjs, 3js React Native and Firebase.
